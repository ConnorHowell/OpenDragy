# BLE/UART bridge
This is code based (well mostly just lifted completly and modified slightly) on an example included in the NRF5 SDK.  It has been modified to handle two way communcation to a GPS (though not restricted to being used with a GPS - It just in in our case).

Compiled and tested against the nRF5 SDK version 160098a08e2

Compiled with the free verison of the SEGGER Embedded Studio for Arm v4.52b.

You will need to edit the DIYDrag.emProject file and update the path to the nRF SDK for your install.  Change the path "/Users/chris/Documents/nRF5SDK160098a08e2" to what ever it is on your system.
