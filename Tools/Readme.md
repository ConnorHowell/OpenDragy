# Development Tools
Some tools that help during the development process

- GPSUDPSend.py - This python script opens a DIYDragy.db file and sends the logged GPS data contained to a UDP port.  This helps during development and testing when running DIYDragy via the iOS simulator since the simulator can't connect to the BLE hardware directly.
